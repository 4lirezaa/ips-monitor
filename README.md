# ips-monitor

built an automated monitoring system using GitHub Actions, Google Sheets, and Python that detects any change in the IP address behind CDN-backed domains.
Whenever a new IP is observed, it automatically logs the update to a Google Sheet and sends a Telegram notification â€” all without the need for a server.
